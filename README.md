Hey, this is my module, Orientation Hypercube!

This module is inspired by [Orientation Cube](https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Orientation%20Cube.html), and aims to build upon it by adding a dimension and making the read more interesting (and, importantly, it shouldn't be so easy to cheatsheet it!!).

To report bugs, please contact Kuro#2011 on Discord.
